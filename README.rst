========================
Snackabra Python Library
========================

This repo contains the Python utility libraries for snackabra.

For all snackabra documentation, including this pylib API, see:

* https://snackabra.io

If you would like to contribute or help out with the snackabra
project, please feel free to reach out to us at snackabra@gmail.com or
snackabra@protonmail.com


Installation
============

Requires Python >= 3.8.  If you're simply using the library, you
should just need to install the ``snackabra`` package:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install snackabra


The rest of this README is for package contributors.


Developers
==========


You'll need (Python 3.8 or higher):

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r ./requirement.txt
   $ python -m build

Results will be in 'dist'.

To test deploy to testpypi (you'll need an account and a token, and
use "__token__" as user). 

.. code-block:: console

   python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/snackabra-N.N.N*

Remember to bump version number in setup.cfg: "A.B.C" where "A.B"
should match the overall snackabra version numbers, and "C" simply
track fixes to the library - ergo the CLI should simply have a
requirement (for example) ">=0.4.0" if it (the CLI) is version "0.4".

For (final) live update, of course:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m twine upload dist/snackabra-N.N.N*

*Note: don't use wildcard "dist/*".*


Simple Testing
--------------

*(Trivial - actual tests real soon now.)*

.. code-block:: console
		
   # (create a scratch directory)
   $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   $ python3.8 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bint/activate
   $ python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps snackabra

Note "no-deps" - the test pip server doesn't have all dependencies (in
our case, last I tried it didn't have jwcrypto), so you manually:


.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
   $ python
   >>> import snackabra.crypto
   >>> help(snackabra.crypto)
