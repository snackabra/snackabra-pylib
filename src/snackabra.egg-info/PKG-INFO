Requires Python >= 3.8

Python utility libraries for snackabra

If you're simply using it, you should just need:

```
pip install snackabra
```

The rest of this README is for package maintainers.

# Package development

You'll need:

```
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bint/activate
$ pip install build
$ pip install twine
$ python -m build
```

Results will be in 'dist'.

To test deploy to testpypi (you'll need an account and a token, and
use "__token__" as user). 

```
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/snackabra-N.N.N*
```

Remember to bump version number in setup.cfg: "A.B.C" where "A.B"
should match the overall snackabra version numbers, and "C" simply
track fixes to the library - ergo the CLI should simply have a
requirement (for example) ">=0.3.0" if it (the CLI) is version "0.3".

For live update, of course:

```
python -m twine upload dist/snackabra-N.N.N*
```

Note: we don't (currently) do "dist/*" because we want to keep on git
older versions.

# Simple test of package

```
# (create a scratch directory)
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bint/activate
$ python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps snackabra
```

Note "no-deps" - the test pip server doesn't have all dependencies (in
our case, last I tried it didn't have jwcrypto), so you manually need
to:

```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
$ python
>>> import snackabra.crypto
>>> help(snackabra.crypto)
```
